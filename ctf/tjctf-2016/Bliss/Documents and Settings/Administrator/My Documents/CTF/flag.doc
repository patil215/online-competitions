\pard\sb100\sa100\par
\pard\keepn\sb100\sa100\kerning36\b\fs48 Prepare for Setup\par
\pard\sb100\sa100\kerning0\b0\fs24 There are four important steps you should take before you start Setup:\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100\tx720{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "\\\\l "a""}}{\fldrslt{\cf1\ul Run an upgrade report}}}\cf0\ulnone\f0\fs24  \endash  it only takes a few minutes to check system compatibility. \par

{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "\\\\l "c""}}{\fldrslt{\cf1\ul Back up your files}}}\cf0\ulnone\f0\fs24  either by using the Backup Wizard that is built into Windows, or by using another backup program. \par
{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "\\\\l "d""}}{\fldrslt{\cf1\ul Decide which type of Setup you want}}}\cf0\ulnone\f0\fs24  \endash  an upgrade or a new installation. \par
\pard\sb100\sa100 Doing these four steps \i before\i0  starting Setup can save you time in the long run.\par
\pard\keepn\sb100\sa100\b\fs36 Run an upgrade report\par
\pard\sb100\sa100\b0\fs24 An upgrade report tells you how your hardware and software will work with Windows XP. The upgrade report is a quick and easy program that you can run using the Windows XP CD. Here's how:\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100\tx720 Insert the Windows XP CD into your CD-ROM drive. \par
When the \b Welcome\b0  menu appears, click \b Check system compatibility\b0 . \par
Then click \b Check my system automatically\b0 . \par
\pard\sb100\sa100 You can also find information about your computer's devices (such as printers, scanners, and so on) at the device manufacturer's Web site, in the Windows Catalog, and on the Microsoft Hardware Compatibility List (HCL): \par
{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=20496"}}{\fldrslt{\cf1\ul Text version of the HCL (for all operating systems)}}}\cf0\ulnone\f0\fs24\line (https://winqual.microsoft.com/download/default.asp)\par

{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=18784"}}{\fldrslt{\cf1\ul The Windows Catalog}}}\cf0\ulnone\f0\fs24\line (http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/)\par
You can get to all of the above from {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=14123"}}{\fldrslt{\cf1\ul Windows Hardware and Driver Central}}}\cf0\ulnone\f0\fs24  (http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/hcl/default.mspx)\par
What do you do if something is incompatible with Windows XP? You can upgrade either the hardware or software in question, find a similar but compatible program or device, or you can remove the program or device and stop using it. To upgrade, contact the manufacturer. To find compatible programs and devices, check the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=18784"}}{\fldrslt{\cf1\ul Windows Catalog}}}\cf0\ulnone\f0\fs24  (http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/). To remove a program, go to Control Panel and open Add or Remove Programs.\par
\pard\keepn\sb100\sa100\b\fs36 Disable virus protection (antivirus) software\par
\pard\sb100\sa100\b0\fs24 Virus protection software sometimes interferes with Setup, so make sure that you disable it before you begin installing Windows XP. For instructions about how to do this, refer to the documentation for your virus protection software.\par
After setting up Windows XP, remember to enable the virus protection program. In some cases you will need an updated version of the software, which you might be able to download from the software manufacturer's Web site.\par
\pard\keepn\sb100\sa100\b\fs36 Back up your files\par
\pard\sb100\sa100\b0\fs24 Back up any files that you want to preserve, just in case something goes awry. Depending on how many files you have, you can copy them to a floppy disk, removable drive, or CD, or to a network folder if you have a network. You can copy the files directly or use the Backup Wizard included with most versions of Windows. This wizard is located in the Accessories\\System Tools folder on the \b Start\b0  menu.\par
\b Note:\b0  You cannot restore a backup in Windows XP that you created by using the Msbackup tool in Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Millennium Edition. For more information about this issue, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 305381, "Cannot Restore Backups That You Create in Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Me with the Windows XP NTBackup Tool."\par
\pard\keepn\sb100\sa100\b\fs36 Decide which type of Setup you want\par
\pard\sb100\sa100\b0\fs24 There are basically three different types of Setup: an upgrade, a new installation (also known as a \i clean installation\i0  or a \i full installation\i0 ), and a multiboot installation. \b\i Hint:\b0  we highly recommend the first one!\i0\par
\b Upgrade\b0 . This is the easiest method of installing Windows XP. We recommend you use this method if you are running a previous version of Windows. When you upgrade, you replace the existing operating system with Windows XP, but your data and most user settings should not be affected. (It's always a good idea to back up your files before starting, just in case.)\par
You can upgrade from Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, Windows Millennium Edition, Windows NT Workstation 4 (Service Pack 6), or Windows 2000 Professional.\par
\b Note:\b0  Windows 2000 can only be upgraded to Windows XP Professional. See Microsoft Knowledge Base article 292607 for supported upgrade paths. Also see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 316941 for an overview of the Windows XP Setup process.\par
\b Tip:\b0  To find a Microsoft Knowledge Base article, go to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=992"}}{\fldrslt{\cf1\ul Microsoft Help and Support}}}\cf0\ulnone\f0\fs24  (http://support.microsoft.com), type the article number in the \b Search the Knowledge Base\b0  box, and press ENTER.\par
\b New installation\b0 . Also known as a full installation or a clean installation, this method requires a little more work than an upgrade. A new installation can install Windows XP on another drive or partition without disturbing an existing installation, or you can choose to wipe out everything on your hard drive so that you "start from scratch." \b You should definitely back up your files before doing a new installation!\b0  As part of a new installation, you can also partition and format your hard drive. It's best to do this as part of Setup, rather than doing it in advance (as you might have done with previous versions of Windows). We'll get to that.\par
\b Multiboot installation\b0 . The hardest of all three, this method is a variation of the new installation process that lets you run more than one operating system on your computer. For example, you can have both Windows XP and Windows 98 installed. To switch from one to the other, you restart the computer and choose an operating system from a menu that appears when the computer starts. Sounds cool, but don't attempt this unless you are an advanced computer user.\par
\pard\keepn\sb100\sa100\kerning36\b\fs48 Upgrade to Windows XP\par
\pard\sb100\sa100\kerning0\fs24 Note:\b0  Before installing Windows XP, you should disable your virus protection (antivirus) software, and you might want to run the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool to test your computer's random access memory (RAM). To use the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool, follow the instructions on the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19751"}}{\fldrslt{\cf1\ul Windows Memory Diagnostic}}}\cf0\ulnone\f0\fs24  (http://oca.microsoft.com/en/windiag.asp) Web site. Be sure to enable your virus protection software after installing Windows XP.\par
When you upgrade to Windows XP, you install Windows to the same folder where your current version of Windows is located, updating the earlier version. Here's how:\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100\tx720 Start your computer. Also, make sure you have your product key handy. \par
Insert the Windows XP CD into your computer's CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive. \par
On the menu that appears, click \b Install Windows XP\b0 . \par
On the \b Welcome to Windows Setup\b0  page, click \b Upgrade (recommended)\b0  (if it is not already selected), and then click \b Next\b0 . (You should click \b Next\b0  on each screen from here on.) \par
On the \b License Agreement\b0  page, read the agreement, and follow the instructions to accept or reject the agreement. \par
On the \b Your Product Key\b0  page, type the 25-character product key in the appropriate boxes. \par
On the \b Get Updated Setup Files\b0  page, select the option that you want. \b\i Hint:\b0  It's a really good idea to select \b Yes\b0  and get the updated files, but you can only do this if you're able to connect to the Internet.\i0  \par
\pard\li720\sb100\sa100\b Note:\b0  Some of the problems addressed in the troubleshooting section of this document are prevented by getting the updated Setup files.\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100\tx720 During this phase of Setup, the computer will restart several times, and you'll see screens telling you about new features in Windows XP. This part of Setup takes a while. It's a good time to go have a cup of coffee or take a break. \par
Finally, the computer restarts one last time and Windows XP starts. \par
\pard\sb100\sa100 Do not forget to enable your virus protection software after Setup is finished.\par
\pard\keepn\sb100\sa100\kerning36\b\fs48 Perform a new installation of Windows XP\par
\pard\sb100\sa100\kerning0\b0\fs24 If your computer does not have an operating system currently installed or you have decided to install Windows from scratch, you can perform what is known as a new installation (also known as a \i clean installation\i0 , or a \i full installation\i0 ). This process is more complicated and takes longer than an upgrade (about 20 steps as opposed to 9 for an upgrade). To perform an upgrade, refer to the section titled "{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "\\\\l "_Toc42069041""}}{\fldrslt{\cf1\ul Upgrade to Windows XP}}}\cf0\ulnone\f0\fs24 ."\par
\b Note:\b0  Before installing Windows XP, you should disable you virus protection (antivirus) software, and you might want to run the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool to test your computer's random access memory (RAM). To use the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool, follow the instructions on the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19751"}}{\fldrslt{\cf1\ul Windows Memory Diagnostic}}}\cf0\ulnone\f0\fs24  (http://oca.microsoft.com/en/windiag.asp) Web site. Be sure to enable your virus protection software after installing Windows XP.\par
\b CAUTION:\b0  You can choose to delete everything that currently exists on the hard drive during a new installation, so be sure to back up any data you want to keep before you begin (make sure that the backup data is not stored on the drive you are going to delete).\par
Here's how to perform a new installation of Windows XP:\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100\tx720 Insert the Windows XP CD into the CD-ROM drive. \par
\pard\li720\sb100\sa100\b Note:\b0  Make sure the computer can boot from a CD. If it can't, then follow the procedures in the section titled "{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "\\\\l "_Toc42069048""}}{\fldrslt{\cf1\ul Configure a computer to boot from CD}}}\cf0\ulnone\f0\fs24 " or see the "How do I install Windows from the command prompt?" section under "{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "\\\\l "_Toc42069045""}}{\fldrslt{\cf1\ul Perform other Setup-related tasks}}}\cf0\ulnone\f0\fs24 ."\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100\tx720 Restart the computer. \par
When the message to \b Press any key to boot from CD\'85\b0  is displayed, quickly press any key (for example, the SPACEBAR). Setup begins. \par
\pard\li720\sb100\sa100\b Note:\b0  Pay close attention here, because it's very easy to miss this message. If your current operating system starts, you'll know that you missed the opportunity to boot from CD. Restart your computer and try again.\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100\tx720 After Setup starts, several messages will flash across the bottom of the screen. These messages are only important under special circumstances, such as installing a particular hardware access layer (HAL), or loading a small computer system interface (SCSI) driver. Most people can ignore them. For more information about this subject, see Microsoft Knowledge Base articles 295116 and 220845. \par
Next, a screen appears that offers the following three options: \b Set up Windows XP\b0 , \b Repair a Windows XP installation\b0 , or \b Quit Setup\b0 . Press ENTER to select the first option. \par
The End User License Agreement appears next. Read the license agreement and follow the instructions to accept or reject the agreement. If your Windows CD is an upgrade CD, after accepting the agreement, you will be prompted to insert the CD of your previous operating system to verify that the previous version qualifies for upgrade to Windows XP. \par
\pard\li720\sb100\sa100\b Important!\b0  If you use a recovery CD from an original equipment manufacturer (also called an OEM), it is possible that the CD will not be accepted. If you delete the partition information or format the drive and the OEM recovery CD is not accepted as valid media, you must use the OEM recovery CD to restore your previous version of Windows. For details about restoring your system using the OEM recovery media, please contact your computer manufacturer.\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100\tx720 If a screen appears showing an existing installation of Windows XP, press ESC to continue installing a fresh copy of Windows XP. \par
At the next screen, you have the option of repartitioning your drive. It's a good idea to repartition if you want to merge several smaller partitions into one large one, or if you want to create several smaller partitions so that you can set up a multiboot configuration. If you want to repartition, follow the instructions to delete existing partitions, if needed, and then select unpartitioned space and press ENTER to proceed. \par
\pard\li720\sb100\sa100\b CAUTION:\b0  Deleting a partition will remove all data stored on that partition. Before you continue, make sure you have backed up everything you want to keep.\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100\tx720 Select the formatting method you would like to use, and then press ENTER. NTFS offers both enhanced formatting capabilities and security technologies. If you need to access drives or DOS files (such as from a DOS-based boot disk) using Windows Millennium Edition or earlier versions of Windows, you might need to select FAT32 instead. Select either format method (quick or slow). \par
Setup will format the drive, copy initial Setup files, and restart the computer. \par
\pard\li720\sb100\sa100\b Note:\b0  After the computer restarts, you will again receive the message \b Press any key to boot from CD\b0  but you should ignore it so that you do not interrupt the current installation process.\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100\tx720 After another restart, the next part of Setup will begin. \par
On the \b Regional and Language Options\b0  page, follow the instructions to add language support or change language settings, if desired. \par
On the \b Personalize Your Software\b0  page, type your name and the name of your company or organization (if applicable). \par
On the \b Your Product Key\b0  page, type the 25-character product key that came with your copy of Windows XP. \par
On the \b Computer Name and Administrator Password\b0  page, make up a computer name (if your network administrator gave you a name to use, type that). Then make up a password for the Administrator account on your computer. Type it once, and then confirm it by typing it again. \par
\pard\li720\sb100\sa100\b Important\b0 : Be sure to remember the Administrator password. You'll need this password when you want to make changes to your system in the future.\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100\tx720 On the \b Date and Time Settings\b0  page, make any changes that are necessary. \par
On the \b Networking Settings\b0  page, if it appears, select \b Typical settings\b0  (unless you plan to manually configure your networking components). \par
On the \b Workgroup or Computer Domain\b0  page, click \b Next\b0 . If you want to add your computer to a domain, select the second option and fill in the domain name. (If you do this, you will be prompted for a user name and password.) \par
\pard\li720\sb100\sa100\b Note:\b0  Connecting to a domain is only possible in Windows XP Professional, not in Windows XP Home Edition.\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100\tx720 Next, while Setup copies files to your computer and completes a few other tasks, you'll see a series of screens that tell you about new features in Windows XP. \par
Finally, your computer will restart. Again, ignore the message to press any key. After Setup completes, eject the CD from the CD-ROM drive. \par
\pard\sb100\sa100 Do not forget to enable your virus protection software after Setup is finished.\par
\pard\keepn\sb100\sa100\kerning36\b\fs48 Transfer files and settings from another computer\par
\pard\sb100\sa100\kerning0\b0\fs24 Did you ever wish that you could easily transfer your files and settings from an old computer to a new one? The Files and Settings Transfer Wizard available in Windows XP can assist you in doing this. This wizard helps take the pain out of upgrading to a new computer.\par
Here's how to use this wizard:\par
\b On your new computer:\b0\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100\tx720 Click \b Start\b0 , and then click \b Files and Settings Transfer Wizard\b0 . \par
On the \b Welcome\b0  page of the wizard, click \b Next\b0 . \par
On the \b Which computer is this?\b0  page, select \b New computer\b0 . \par
On the \b Do you have a Windows XP CD?\b0  page, select \b I will use the wizard from the Windows XP CD\b0 , unless you don't have a Windows XP CD. If that is the case, you will need to make a Wizard Disk so that you can run the wizard on your old computer. Select the first option and follow the instructions to make the Wizard Disk. \par
Now go to your old computer (or the computer that you're transferring files and settings \ul from\ulnone ). \par
\pard\sb100\sa100\b On your old computer:\b0\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100\tx720 If you don't have a Windows XP CD, insert the Wizard Disk that you created into the floppy drive. Click \b Start\b0 , click \b Run\b0 , and then click \b Browse\b0 . Browse to your floppy drive and then double-click the \b MigWiz.exe\b0  file. In the \b Run\b0  dialog box, click \b OK\b0 . \par
\pard\li720\sb100\sa100 If you do have a Windows XP CD, insert it into the CD-ROM drive of the computer you want to copy files and settings \ul from\ulnone  and wait for the startup menu to appear. If the menu does not appear automatically, click \b Start\b0 , click \b Run\b0 , and then click \b Browse\b0 . Browse to your CD-ROM drive and then double-click the \b Setup.exe\b0  file. In the \b Run\b0  dialog box, click \b OK\b0 . Click \b Perform additional tasks\b0 , and then click \b Transfer files and settings\b0 .\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100\tx720 On the \b Welcome\b0  page of the Files and Settings Transfer Wizard, click \b Next\b0 . \par
On the \b Which computer is this?\b0  page, select \b Old computer\b0 . \par
On the \b Select a transfer method\b0  page, choose a method that will work for both computers. For example, you can place the files and settings on a network drive that both computers have access to, or you can use a removable drive. Whatever method you choose, \ul both\ulnone  computers must be able to use it. \par
On the \b What do you want to transfer?\b0  page, select one of the three options. Depending on the type of transfer method you choose, some options are better than others here. For instance, if you plan to transfer more than just a few files and settings, choose a method other than floppy disks (since those have the lowest storage capacity). If you decide to change your transfer method, you can always click \b Back\b0 . \par
\pard\li720\sb100\sa100 On this page, you can also select a check box that lets you choose a custom list of files and settings to be transferred. This option is for advanced users.\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100\tx720 At this point, you might see a message telling you to install certain programs on your new computer before continuing. This step is not required, but those programs might not work correctly without doing this. \par
The wizard now collects the files and settings you requested and prepares to transfer them to the new computer. Insert a disk or removable drive when prompted, if you are using one of those methods. \par
On the \b Completing the Collection Phase\b0  page, click \b Finish\b0 . Then go to your new computer, taking along any disk or CD you have used. \par
\pard\sb100\sa100\b On your new computer:\b0\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100\tx720 Click \b Start\b0 , and then click \b Files and Settings Transfer Wizard\b0 . \par
On the \b Welcome\b0  page, click \b Next\b0 . \par
On the \b Which computer is this?\b0  page, select \b New computer\b0 . \par

\pard\keepn\sb100\sa100\kerning36\b\fs48 Partition and format a hard drive\par
\pard\sb100\sa100\kerning0\b0\fs24 If there are no partitions on your hard drive, you will need to create a partition and format it. Alternatively, it's a good idea to repartition your hard drive if you want to merge several smaller partitions into one large one, or if you want to create several smaller partitions so that you can set up a multiboot configuration.\par
If you want to partition or format your hard drive, we recommend that you use the disk partitioning and formatting tools that are built into Windows XP Setup. These tools allow you to delete existing partitions and to create one or more new partitions. \par
\b IMPORTANT:\b0  If you follow these steps on a hard disk that is not empty, all of the data stored on that hard disk will be permanently deleted.\par
To use the disk partitioning and formatting tools in Windows XP Setup:\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100\tx720 Insert the Windows XP CD into your CD/DVD drive (or insert the first Windows XP Setup boot disk into the floppy disk drive), and then restart the computer. \par
\pard\li720\sb100\sa100\b Note\b0 : To start your computer from the Windows XP CD (or from the Setup boot disk), your computer must be configured to start from the CD/DVD drive (or the floppy disk drive). In some cases, you might have to modify your computer's BIOS settings to do this. For more information, see "{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "\\\\l "_Toc42069048""}}{\fldrslt{\cf1\ul Configure a computer to boot from CD}}}\cf0\ulnone\f0\fs24 ."\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100\tx720 If you are starting the computer from the Windows XP CD, press a key to boot from CD when you are prompted to do so. If you are starting from the Windows XP Setup boot disks, insert each of the additional disks when prompted, and then press ENTER to continue after inserting each disk. \par
At the \b Welcome to Setup\b0  page, press ENTER to continue. \par
On the \b License Agreement\b0  page, read the agreement, and then follow the instructions for accepting or rejecting the agreement. \par
If an existing Windows XP installation is detected, you will be prompted to repair it. Press ESC (do not repair). \par
All existing partitions and unpartitioned spaces are listed for each physical hard disk. Use the arrow keys to select the partition or unpartitioned space where you want to create a new partition, and then press D to delete an existing partition or press C to create a new partition using unpartitioned space. \par
\pard\li720\sb100\sa100 If you press D to delete an existing partition, you must then press L (or press ENTER, and then press L if it is the System partition) to confirm that you want to delete the partition. Repeat this process for each of the existing partitions that you want to use for the new partition. When all the partitions are deleted, select the resulting unpartitioned space and press C to create a new partition.\par
\b Note:\b0  If you want to create a partition where one or more partitions already exist, you must first delete the existing partition or partitions and then create the new partition.\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100\tx720 Type the size (in megabytes, or MB) that you want to use for the new partition, and then press ENTER, or just press ENTER to create the partition using the maximum size. \par
If you want to create additional partitions, repeat steps 6 and 7. \par
If you want to install Windows XP, use the arrow keys to select the partition you want to install it on, and then press ENTER. If you do not want to format the partition and install Windows XP, press F3 two times to quit Setup, and then do not continue with the following steps. In this case, you must use another program to format the partition. \par
Select the format option that you want to use for the partition, and then press ENTER. The options are: \par
\pard{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf2\pnindent360{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li1440\sb100\sa100 Format the partition by using the NTFS file system (Quick) \par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Format the partition by using the FAT file system (Quick) \par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Format the partition by using the NTFS file system \par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Format the partition by using the FAT file system \par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Leave the current file system intact (no changes) \par
\pard\li720\sb100\sa100 For most configurations, NTFS is a good choice for security and flexibility. If you plan to install a multiboot configuration and access data on the drive using older operating systems such as Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Millennium Edition, however, select FAT.\par
When you format a volume, files are removed from the volume and the hard disk is scanned for bad sectors. The majority of the time required to format a volume is devoted to scanning the disk. If you choose the Quick format option, files are removed from the partition, but the disk is not scanned for bad sectors. You should only use this option if your hard disk has been previously formatted and you are sure that your hard disk is not damaged.\par
\b Note:\b0  During Windows XP Setup, the option to leave the current file system intact is not available if the selected partition is a new partition. For partitions up to 2 gigabytes (GB) in size, Setup uses the FAT (also known as FAT16) file system. For partitions greater than 2 GB but less than 32 GB, Setup uses the FAT32 file system. For partitions greater than 32 GB, Setup uses NTFS.\par
\b Note:\b0  If you deleted and created a new System partition but you are installing Windows XP on another partition, you will be prompted to select a file system for both the System and Boot partitions at this point.\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100\tx720 After Setup formats the partition, follow the on-screen instructions to continue Setup. After Setup is complete, you can use the Disk Management tools in Windows XP to create or format additional partitions. \par

\pard\sb100\sa100\kerning0\b0\fs24 A boot disk is a floppy disk or set of disks that lets you start the computer without using Windows. It can be useful to have this when doing certain types of troubleshooting and when performing a new installation of Windows. \par
You can download a program to create the six Windows XP Setup boot floppy disks that contain the files and drivers required to access the CD-ROM drive and begin the Setup process. To do this, go to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=20508"}}{\fldrslt{\cf1\ul Obtaining Windows XP Setup Boot Disks}}}\cf0\ulnone\f0\fs24  (http://support.microsoft.com:80/support/kb/articles/q310/9/94.asp).\par
However, rather than creating boot disks, we recommend that you boot your computer from the Windows XP CD to start Setup. If your computer is not already able to do this (most newer computers are), refer to the section titled "{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "\\\\l "_Toc42069048""}}{\fldrslt{\cf1\ul Configure a computer to boot from CD}}}\cf0\ulnone\f0\fs24 " for more information. If your computer does not support booting from CD, you can download a file that will help you create boot disks. See the list at the end of this section for download locations.\par
\pard\keepn\sb100\sa100\b\fs36 Creating the Setup boot disks\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100\tx720\b0\fs24 When you download the Setup disks, the download contains only one large program file. When you run the downloaded file, it extracts the files to individual floppy disks. You receive the following prompt: \par
\pard\li720\sb100\sa100\b This program creates the Setup boot disks for Microsoft Windows XP. \b0\par
To create these disks, you need to provide 6 blank, formatted, high-density disks.\par
Please specify the floppy drive to copy the images to.\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100\tx720 Type the drive letter for the floppy disk drive (this is typically drive A). After you type the floppy disk drive letter, you see the following prompt: \par
\pard\li720\sb100\sa100 Insert one of these disks into drive <drive letter>:. This disk will become the Windows XP Setup Boot Disk.\par
Press any key when you are ready.\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100\tx720 When you press a key, the downloaded file starts extracting and copying the files. Continue inserting the blank disks as you are prompted to do so until all six disks are created. If the process is interrupted, you must run the downloaded program file again to create all six disks. \par
Label each disk with the number that is specified by the program. You must use the disks in the correct order during the Setup process. \par
After you create all six disks, insert the first disk in the floppy disk drive, and then restart the computer. Note that the computer must be configured to boot from the floppy disk drive. Most computers will do this automatically, but in some cases, you might need to modify your computer's BIOS settings to do this. For information about modifying your computer's BIOS settings, refer to the section titled "{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "\\\\l "_Toc42069048""}}{\fldrslt{\cf1\ul Configure a computer to boot from CD}}}\cf0\ulnone\f0\fs24 ." \par
When you restart the computer, the Setup process begins. Insert each floppy disk as you are prompted to do so. You will then be prompted for the Windows XP CD to finish Setup. \par
\pard\keepn\sb100\sa100\kerning36\b\fs48 Configure a computer to boot from CD\par
\pard\sb100\sa100\kerning0\b0\fs24 Some computers might automatically offer the option to boot from CD if they detect a bootable CD in the CD-ROM drive. If so, when you start the computer with a bootable CD in the CD-ROM drive, you'll see the message "Press any key to boot from CD." Otherwise, you can set your computer to boot from CD by using the setup program for your computer's BIOS (basic input/output system). Here's how:\par
\pard{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf2\pnindent360{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100 When you first start the computer, look for a short message telling you which key to press for setup. For example, some computers will have this message: \b Press DELETE to enter setup\b0 . \par
\pard\li720\sb100\sa100 If your computer doesn't give you such a message, try pressing these commonly used keys during startup: \par
\pard{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf2\pnindent360{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li1440\sb100\sa100 DELETE \par

{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}F2 \par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}F3, then F2 \par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}F10 \par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}CTRL+ALT+ESC \par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}CTRL+ALT+S \par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}ESC \par
\pard\li720\sb100\sa100 If graphics appear during startup, pressing ESC often makes the graphics disappear so that you can see the correct key for entering BIOS setup.\par
\pard{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf2\pnindent360{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100 When you see the message, quickly press the indicated key. You will enter a DOS-like program that consists of one or more screens. You probably won't be able to use the mouse while in this program. BIOS programs vary widely, but look for an option called "Boot order" or something similar. \par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Set the boot order to boot from CD before booting from the hard drive. \par
\pard\sb100\sa100 Some newer laptop computers have a Windows-based utility for configuring the BIOS. If your computer won't boot from a CD, refer to the section titled "Other Setup-related tasks" for information about starting Setup from the command prompt.\par
\pard\keepn\sb100\sa100\kerning36\b\fs48 Set up a multiboot system\par
\pard\sb100\sa100\kerning0\b0\fs24 You can install more than one operating system on your computer and choose which operating system you want to use every time you start your computer. This is called a dual-boot or multiboot configuration. This section explains how to set up Windows XP as a multiboot system with the following operating systems: \par
\pard{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf2\pnindent360{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100 Windows 2000, Windows NT 4.0, and Windows NT 3.51 \par

\pard\keepn\sb100\sa100\b\fs36 Precautions\par
\pard\sb100\sa100\b0\fs24 Before creating a multiboot configuration with Windows XP and another operating system, review the following precautions:\par
\pard{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf2\pnindent360{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100 Be sure to back up your current system and all data files. \par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Each operating system must be installed on a separate volume. Microsoft does not support installing multiple operating systems on the same volume. \par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}If you have only one volume on your computer, you have to reformat and repartition your hard disk to contain multiple volumes before you begin creating a multiboot configuration, unless you are simply installing another copy of Windows XP. \par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Do not install Windows XP on a compressed drive that was not compressed using the NTFS compression utility. \par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Before installing Windows XP, you should disable antivirus software, and you might want to run the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool to test your computer's random access memory (RAM). To use the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool, follow the instructions on the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19751"}}{\fldrslt{\cf1\ul Windows Memory Diagnostic}}}\cf0\ulnone\f0\fs24  (http://oca.microsoft.com/en/windiag.asp) Web site. Be sure to enable your virus protection software after installing Windows XP. \par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}You must use a different computer name for each operating system if the computer is on a Windows 2000 or Windows XP domain. \par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}The operating systems should be installed from oldest to newest. If possible, install operating systems in the following order: \par

\pard\li1440\sb100\sa100\b Note:\b0  You cannot install Windows Millennium Edition over any version of Windows NT, but they can exist together on a single system. It is recommended that you install each to a separate hard disk or partition. If Windows NT is already installed, Windows Millennium Edition Setup will add itself to the Windows NT boot menu to allow you to multiboot between Windows Millennium Edition and Windows NT. For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 271240.\par

\pard\keepn\sb100\sa100\b\fs36 Partitioning the hard disk and selecting file systems\par
\pard\sb100\sa100\b0\fs24 A partition is a logical section of a hard disk. Each partition normally has its own file system. For more information about partitions, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 313348.\par
You might need to reformat and repartition your hard disk if:\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100\tx720 You have only one volume but you want to set up a multiboot configuration. You have to install each operating system on a separate volume so that each installation can retain its own files and configuration information. \par
The boot volume is not formatted with the correct file system: \par
\pard\fi-360\li1440\sb100\sa100\tx1440 If you want to create a multiboot system by using Windows 95, Windows 98 or Windows Millennium Edition along with Microsoft Windows XP, you have to format the boot volume by using FAT because Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows Millennium Edition do not support the NTFS file system. \par
If you want to install Windows 95 (retail version 4.00.950), your boot volume must be formatted as FAT. Windows 95 (OSR2.1 and above) can have a FAT32 boot volume and dual boot with Windows 2000 and Windows XP. For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 258662. \par
If you want to create a multiboot system using Windows 95 OSR2, Windows 98, or Windows Millennium Edition with Windows 2000 or Windows XP, you can format the boot volume by using FAT32. \par
\pard\sb100\sa100\b Note:\b0  If you format a Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, or Windows XP volume with any file system other than NTFS, you will lose all NTFS-specific features. This includes Windows XP features such as file system security, Encrypting File System (EFS) settings, disk quotas, and remote storage. Likewise, Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows Millennium Edition do not recognize an NTFS partition; they will identify it as unknown. Therefore, if you format a Windows 98 or Windows Millennium Edition partition as FAT, and a Windows XP partition as NTFS, any files on the NTFS partition will not be available or visible if you try to access them while running Windows 98 or Windows Millennium Edition.\par

\pard\keepn\sb100\sa100\kerning36\b\fs48 Repair or recover a system\par
\pard\sb100\sa100\kerning0\b0\fs24 You can repair or recover your system in several different ways. Instructions for each method are below. Try the methods in this order:\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100\tx720 Revert to the "Last Known Good" configuration. \par
Start the computer in Safe Mode and try to fix the problem. \par
Use the Windows XP Recovery Console. \par
Use System Restore. \par
Use Automated System Recovery (works for Windows XP Professional only, not Windows XP Home Edition). \par
\pard\keepn\sb100\sa100\b\fs36 To use the Last Known Good configuration:\par
\pard\sb100\sa100\b0\fs24 If Windows XP will not start, you can restore your system to the Last Known Good configuration \endash  in other words, your most recent settings that worked. Here's how:\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100\tx720 Start the computer and then press the F8 key when Windows begins to start. The \b Windows Advanced Options\b0  menu appears. \par
Use the arrow keys to select \b Last Known Good Configuration (your most recent settings that worked)\b0 , and then press ENTER. \par
If a boot menu appears, use the arrow keys to select \b Microsoft Windows XP\b0 , and then press ENTER. Windows XP restores the computer to the most recent restore point. \par
\pard\keepn\sb100\sa100\b\fs36 To use the Windows XP Recovery Console:\par
\pard\sb100\sa100\b0\fs24 The Windows XP Recovery Console allows you to:\par
\pard{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf2\pnindent360{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100 Use, copy, rename, or replace operating system files and folders. \par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Enable or disable service or device startup when you next start your computer. \par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Repair the file system boot sector or the Master Boot Record (MBR). \par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Create and format partitions on drives. \par
\pard\sb100\sa100 Here's how to use the Recovery Console:\par
\pard{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf2\pnindent360{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100 Insert the Windows XP CD into your CD-ROM drive, and then restart your computer. \par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}On the menu that appears, click \b Install Windows XP\b0 . \par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Press R to repair the selected Windows installation. \par
\pard\sb100\sa100 When you use the Recovery Console, you will be prompted to enter the Administrator account password. If you enter an incorrect password three times, the Recovery Console will close. If the database that contains user account information for your computer is missing or damaged, you will not be able to use the Recovery Console.\par
After you enter your password and the Recovery Console starts, type \b exit\b0  to restart the computer. The Recovery Console has some other limitations. For details, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 314058: Description of the Windows XP Recovery Console.\par
\pard\keepn\sb100\sa100\b\fs36 To use System Restore\par
\pard\sb100\sa100\b0\fs24 The following section describes how to use the System Restore tool to return your computer to a previous working state. System Restore takes a "snapshot" of critical system files and some program files and stores this information as restore points. You can use these restore points to return Windows XP to a previous state.\par
\pard\keepn\sb100\sa100\b\fs28 To create a restore point\par
\pard\sb100\sa100\b0\fs24 Creating a restore point is useful any time you anticipate making changes to your computer that are risky or that might make your computer unstable.\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100\tx720 To access the System Restore Wizard, click \b Start\b0 , and then click \b Help and Support\b0 . Click \b Performance and Maintenance\b0 , click \b Using System Restore to undo changes\b0 , and then click \b Run the System Restore Wizard\b0 . \par
Click \b Create a restore point\b0 , and then click \b Next\b0 . \par
In the \b Restore point\b0  box, type a name to identify this restore point. System Restore automatically adds to this name the date and time that this restore point is created. \par
To finish creating this restore point, click \b Create\b0 . \par
\pard\keepn\sb100\sa100\b\fs28 Using System Restore to Restore Windows XP\par
\pard\sb100\sa100\b0\fs24 If Windows XP will start, you can use System Restore to set your system back to an earlier, working point. Here's how:\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100\tx720 Log on to Windows as Administrator. \par
Click \b Start\b0 , point to \b All Programs\b0 , point to \b Accessories\b0 , point to \b System Tools\b0 , and then click \b System Restore\b0 . System Restore starts. \par
On the \b Welcome to System Restore\b0  page, click \b Restore my computer to an earlier time\b0  (if it is not already selected), and then click \b Next\b0 . \par
On the \b Select a Restore Point\b0  page, click the most recent system checkpoint in the \b On this list, click a restore point\b0  list, and then click \b Next\b0 . A System Restore message might appear that lists configuration changes that System Restore will make. Click \b OK\b0 . \par
On the \b Confirm Restore Point Selection\b0  page, click \b Next\b0 . System Restore restores the previous Windows XP configuration, and then restarts the computer. \par
Log on to the computer as Administrator. The \b System Restore Restoration Complete\b0  page appears. Click \b OK\b0 . \par
\pard\keepn\sb100\sa100\b\fs36 To use Automated System Recovery:\par
\pard\sb100\sa100\b0\fs24 We recommend that you regularly create backups as part of an overall plan for system recovery.\par
\b Note:\b0  Restoring from backup should be a last resort for system recovery. Use this method only after you have exhausted other options. For example, you should first try starting the computer in Safe Mode and reverting to the Last Known Good configuration. These steps are described earlier in this section.\par
Automated System Recovery (ASR) is a two-part system; it includes ASR backup and ASR restore. The ASR Wizard, located on the \b Start\b0  menu under Accessories\\System Tools\\Backup, does the backup portion. The wizard backs up the system state, system services, and all the disks that are associated with the operating system components. ASR also creates a file that contains information about the backup, the disk configurations (including basic and dynamic volumes), and how to perform a restore.\par
You can access the restore portion by pressing F2 when prompted in the text-mode portion of Setup. ASR reads the disk configurations from the file that it creates. It restores all the disk signatures, volumes, and partitions on the disks that you need to start the computer. ASR will try to restore all the disk configurations, but under some circumstances it might not be able to. ASR then installs a simple installation of Windows and automatically starts a restoration using the backup created by the ASR Wizard.\par
